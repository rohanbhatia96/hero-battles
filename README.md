# Hero Battles

![Node Server Workflow](https://github.com/rohanbhatia96/hero-battles/workflows/Node%20Server%20CD/badge.svg)

I love super heroes. I felt a project like this could brighten up my github portfolio ðŸ˜‰

This is a **fullstack** app built with **Node**, **Express**, **GraphQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **React** and **Redux**. It also features separate **CI/CD** pipelines for the back end and front end.

I used the [Superhero API](https://superheroapi.com/) to fetch details about super heroes.
